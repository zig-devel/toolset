# Zig Devel — a collection of C libraries built with Zig Build.

This collection is inspired by [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/), [Bazel Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/), and the [All Your Codebase project](https://github.com/allyourcodebase).
All projects here are builded, tested, published, documented, and licensed identically.

**Tests:** library has smoke test that checks that the code at least links correctly.

**License:** library licensed under both the 0BSD license and the original project license, so as not to impose any additional restrictions.

**Release:** library versions are pushed to an immutable Github Release, you can be sure that v1.42.0 points to the same commit in all your repositories.
