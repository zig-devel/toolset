# Zig Devel â€” a collection of C libraries built with Zig Build.

This collection is inspired by [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/), [Bazel Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/), and the [All Your Codebase project](https://github.com/allyourcodebase).
All projects here are builded, tested, published, documented, and licensed identically.
